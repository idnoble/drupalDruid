//Create a new content type and add a taxonomy term field to it, which uses the vocabulary you created

Taxonomy modules is a good module that enable sorting and categorize content. It is simply categorizing node into categories.It work such that one can give a blog post a different categories.

There is need for content to be available on the page or many nodes on the page, therefore Content type is one the way to achieve this. Content type has a default Article and basic page. Content type might be needed in situation where we want to specialize features around content. For example ; Creating a product list term around around a product, or allowing people to filter a search, or may be I would want product data to take a Fields, such as Book_type, images etc.

I took the following step in to create my own content type:

SETTING UP A TAXONOMY

1. I went to ->structure ->taxonomy-> add vocabolary, then I give my vocabulary

Name: typeOfProgrammingBooks
Description ; Type of Programming Book then saved.

After that I created news terms for my Vocabulary.

2. To create New Term for vocabulary

I clicked on ->add term  then give it name and Description. Finally I added programming books to my vocabulary.

I went back to taxonomy, I noticed I have a new vocabulary and it has several term list.

3. ADD NEW FIELD TO THE CONTENT TYPE

I went to structure->content type ->book_demo ->edit.Then I click on ->Manage field to add my bookName,Book Description,book-image and set my image size to (book_size) and book_type to term reference[field type] check boxes/radio button.

I selected term reference because I want to link book_type to the book term added in my vocabulary. I was taken to FIELD SETTING in order to select book vocabulary to supply option for the vocabulary field and saved the field setting, I also change the value to unlimited because I might have book that covered Book_type.

Adding New field to the content type
I went to ->content ->add new content ->book_demo then filled all the field required

Now, as new content is added , the content editor will select the appropriate taxonomy term from a checkbox. These categories can be used by Views to group books by category.

//Add an image field to the content type and create some demo contents

//Configure suitable url patterns for new content using the Pathauto module

Pathauto module help user when generating content articles, blog and do not necessary need know in and out of search engine optimization. It allow to automatically use a pardon to generate url alias.

Configuration alias path are shown in the pathauto configuration.

//Add links to some of the demo contents to the primary menu

I added links of my book_demo content I created , I put it under main menu. Menu links are added through ->structure ->menus ->add link

//Grant only one of the custom user roles permission to create/edit/delete contents of the content type you created


To grant permission to one of the user, I created another permission role called authenticated trusted user and I give it to a user called anssi. I give default authenticated user to the second user called jaakko.

Therefore for anssi to be able to create/edit/delete, I go to permission page and enable by checking the box.

STEP TAKEN
I went to people -> click on permission on the TOP-RIGHT CORNER-> click on ->Roles ->add role then create authenticated trusted user.

STEP 2

I went to people -> edit -> authenticated user and put the user into role of Authenticated trusted user and saved

STEP 3

I went to people -> permission and give authenticated trusted user permission to :

book-demo create new content
book-demo edit own content
book-demo delete own content

//Grant unauthenticated users permission to post comments

I went to people->permission then checked post comment box.

//Create a new image style that shows images in exactly 160x90px size

STEP 1

I went to -configuration ->image style ->add style and name my style book_size then went to structure ->content type -> manage display then I clicked a setting icon to select image style(book_size) I created
